===========

Code that I don't want to write again. Enough lines to deserve tests, but not enough for a full blown library.
Please copy/paste if interested.

Some general remarks:
- mainly Scala, but also some Java
- specs2 testing library is used for both Java and Scala pieces of code
- the Scala code uses Exceptions by opposition to Option or Either constructs
- the Java methods will use Google Guava as it makes using Java smoother in a safe and efficient way

Code samples (see test code for complete behaviour) :
